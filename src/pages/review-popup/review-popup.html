          Maverick’s Awareness-Advocacy-Action review or the 3A
          review is an assessment of qualitative changes in terms of
          children’s awareness to their body, their actions to choose
          healthy options, their accountability to stay fit and many more
          which are most crucial for a lifetime committment to be fit!
          These are conducted in schools following the Maverick
          Physical Literacy Curriculum.</p>
