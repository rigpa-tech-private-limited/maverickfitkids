          <p>There must surely be that one spot in your home that everybody needs to cross several times during the day.
            Make that your Fit Spot! Place any one of the Fit Spot decals provided with the Maverick Kit in that spot
            everyday and ensure you perform the exercise for the recommended tin number of times every time you cross
            that
            spot! View the animated exercise here and listen to the instructions here to ensure children learn the
            correct
            form of performing the exercise.</p>
          <br />
          <p>Make it a rule that every member of the family must perform the specified exercise to cross the spot.
            Remember children learn from what they see, so lead by example!</p>
