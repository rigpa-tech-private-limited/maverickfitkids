          <img src="assets/imgs/circles/4_coach.png" class="right" /> Every Maverick Fit Kids session is designed by <b>Gita Krishna Raj</b>, CEO & Program Director, Maverick.
          <br /><br />
          A fitness entrepreneur who combines her academic background of Business administration, Corporate secretaryship and international fitness certifications, with her creative expressions evolved as a renowned Indian classical dancer, powerful orator, spiritualist writer, inspiring actor, international award winning director, Gita leads her team at Maverick to aesthetic heights by incorporating elements of Design Thinking. Gita is a curator at the Physical Literacy India Movement and is part of the International Physical Literacy Association’s education and training team.
          <br /><br />
          Identifying apparently unconnected areas of passion, becoming proficient in each of them and allowing them to flow into each other’s domain in a combinatory play, has resulted in innovative new avenues of creative expression for Gita. The multi-dimensional expertise she has gathered from her life experiences is the backbone of the Maverick Fit Kids curriculum.
