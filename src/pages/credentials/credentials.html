          Identifying apparently unconnected areas of passion, becoming proficient in each of them and allowing them to flow into each other’s domain in a combinatory play, has resulted in innovative new avenues of creative expression for Gita. The multi-dimensional expertise she has gathered from her life experiences is the backbone of the Maverick Fit Kids curriculum.

          Maverick Fit Kids is India’s first physical literacy informed PE
          curriculum in schools since 2014.
          <br /><br />

          Maverick is the exclusive implementation partner of the Sports,
          Physical Education, Fitness & Leisure Council (SPEFL-SC) for schools
          in Tamil Nadu & Puducherry. SPEFL-SC is the Nodal entity for promoting
          physical education in the country formed by the Ministry of Skill
          Development & Entrepreneurship (MSDE).
          <br /><br />

          Maverick is currently the first and only private entity to represent
          the Government of India in presenting a structured physical education
          program in schools through this Government-Private partnership.

          <br /><br />

          The curriculum of Maverick has been designed as a cross curricular
          multi-dimensional approach to physical education - not limiting it to
          only competitive sports. The program draws strength from the physical,
          affective & cognitive demands placed by classical Indian dance, team
          building & sportsmanship from exposure to varied sports, knowledge &
          understanding of health from fitness, and spiritual rootedness to
          value & treat the body with dignity from yoga.

          <br /><br />

          Every Maverick session is designed by Gita Krishna Raj, CEO & Managing
          Director, Maverick, a fitness entrepreneur who combines her academic
          background of a Global MBA and international fitness certifications,
          with her creative expressions evolved as a renowned Indian classical
          dancer, powerful orator, spiritualist writer, inspiring actor,
          international award winning director. Gita is a curator of physical
          literacy and India Ambassador for the International physical Literacy
          Association (IPLA) UK.
